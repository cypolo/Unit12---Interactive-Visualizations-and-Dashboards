In this project we will build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity DataSet](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/).

## DASHBOARD

Use Plotly.js to build interactive charts within a dashboard.
![Example Dashboard Page](Images/dashboard.png)


Create a Bubble Chart that uses data from your samples route (`/samples/<sample>`) to display each sample.

Display the sample metadata from the route `/metadata/<sample>`
